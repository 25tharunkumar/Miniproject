## Title of the Project
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate botnet activities within networks. Botnets, networks of compromised devices controlled by attackers, pose significant threats to cybersecurity. The system employs advanced algorithms to analyze traffic patterns, detect anomalies, and classify malicious activities in real-time.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to detect botnet activities in networks. Botnets are collections of compromised devices under the control of attackers, often used for malicious purposes such as DDoS attacks, data theft, and spam distribution. Detecting botnets is challenging due to their dynamic and stealthy behavior.ollecting network traffic data and logs from various sources, including public datasets or simulated network environments. Preprocessing involves cleaning the data, extracting relevant features, and labeling it as benign or malicious.
